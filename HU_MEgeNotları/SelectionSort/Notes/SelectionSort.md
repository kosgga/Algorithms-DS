# Selection Sort

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm.It is an ***in -place comparison-based algorithm***


The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.

**Not suitable for large data sets its average and worst case complexities are of O(n<sup>2</sup>)
